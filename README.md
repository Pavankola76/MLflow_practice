## 🏡 House Price Prediction with MLflow

This project demonstrates how to use **MLflow** to track, visualize, and manage the machine learning lifecycle for a house price prediction model.

### 🔍 What's in this code

- 🔁 Ran **hyperparameter tuning** during model training using `GridSearchCV`.
- 🧾 **Logged every hyperparameter, metric, and model** to the MLflow tracking server.
- 📊 **Compared multiple runs** interactively in the MLflow UI to evaluate performance.
- ✅ **Selected the best model run** and **registered it** in the MLflow Model Registry for future use or deployment.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)
- MLflow
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git
