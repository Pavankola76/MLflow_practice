- 🧾 **Log every hyperparameter, metric, and model** to the MLflow tracking server.
- 📊 **Compare multiple runs** interactively in the MLflow UI to evaluate performance.
- ✅ **Select the best model run** and **register it** in the MLflow Model Registry for future use or deployment.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)
- MLflow
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git
